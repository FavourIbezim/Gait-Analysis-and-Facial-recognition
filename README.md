# Gait-Analysis-and-Facial-recognition
A multi-modal biometric system for identity verification using gait analysis and facial recognition. Gait features are extracted with scikit-learn and classified using a Random Regression model, while YOLO powers real-time facial detection. Designed for security, surveillance, and healthcare; tested on custom datasets.
